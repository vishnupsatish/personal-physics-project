Over the past few days, I've spent time thinking of an intersection between my passions and physics. Below are some of the ideas I thought of (in no particular order).

1. Cricket: building a cricket ball or a tennis ball thrower/launcher that will enable me to practice shots and strokes without the need of a second person.

2. Cricket: analyzing the swing of a cricket ball â€“ swing is when a cricket ball moves in the air due to an uneven surface.

3. Programming: building a simple physics engine.

4. Programming: analyzing the physics of a game or a movie.

5. Badminton: creating a birdie thrower that will allow me to practice shots.

6. Cricket + Programming: making a piece of software that analyzes the motion of a cricket ball being bowled and using physics to predict its path in certain situations (probably more of a computer science idea than a physics idea).
