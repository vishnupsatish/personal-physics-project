Over the next few weeks, I plan on undertaking the following tasks:

1. Secondary Research: May 7 -> May 15
    - Researching how to utilize motors and wheels to create a launching machine
    - Reach out to friends in Robotics and friends that are interested in mechanical systems for guidance and advice in terms of parts, feedback, etc.
    - Look for parts, while reading specifications and user manuals to ensure compatibility

2. Design machine: May 7 -> May 20
    - Goal is to make it as easy as possible to develop the mechanical system
    - Using secondary research and the design process, create a detailed design for the system, labelling parts, how they interact, etc.
    - Utilize physics theorems learned in SPH3U and SPH4U to deeply understand the interactions between each component and forces present
    - Order parts on trusted websites or go in-person to acquire parts

3. Build/prototype machine: May 17 -> May 26
    - Create a machine using the detailed design and secondary research

4. Testing and adjustments: May 20 -> May 27
    - Test the machine continuously; for speed, direction, etc.
    - Make changes to the machine based on testing results

5. Data collection and analysis: May 22 -> June 1
    - Using physics (forces, momentum, kinematics, energy, etc.) analyze the machine in detail
    - Compare theoretical quantities to measured values to calculate efficiency, energy loss, etc.
    - Aim to understand how circular motion and the forces present in it is converted to acceleration of the tennis ball
