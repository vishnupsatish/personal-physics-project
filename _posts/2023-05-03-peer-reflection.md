After I created a slide describing my idea and project, Emerson made a comment with valid points of feedback and criticism.

One of his key points was whether I would optimize for energy efficiency or have multiple directional/speed settings. As of now,
 no, I wouldn't do that, mostly because of my lack of experience creating mechanical projects. This would be one of the first 
 mechanical system projects I have created, and being decently complex (moving parts, motors, electricity, etc.) I think first
  building a working proof-of-concept would be a good approach. if I build it relatively easily (without major issues or hiccups)
   I will try and develop different settings for speed and/or trajectory.

He also brought up a point regarding budget and how it would constrain me from trying out different materials. I think this a very
 good point that I need to consider, especially because I need to use a material for the spinning wheel that essentiallly grips the 
 tennis ball with its movement and makes it travel. If the wheel's friction is relatively low, the tennis ball wouldn't even travel.
  But I think this can be overcome by researching the properties of the potential materials, such as the friction and other properties. 

I don't think I'll be making many changes. The key change is mostly to research potential materials before outright buying them without
 understand whether they would achieve the goal of launching a tennis ball.
